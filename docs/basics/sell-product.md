# Selling a Product

Since each market operates independently, there is no standard interface to sell a product like there is for buying one. Accepted practices may emerge in the future, but for now, we're leaving this entirely to the market developers to decide.

At this point, you might still be wondering what types of products can be sold using Kiosk. Right now, Kiosk works best for products that allow for instant settlement and do not require exchange of personal information (email, shipping address, etc.). This means Ethereum assets like tokens, ENS domains, and [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) would work well. Other digital assets, like access to a news site or an online course could work too as long as you implement some way to identify the buyer's Ethereum address, such as by requiring them to [cryptographically sign a message](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethsign). We eventually plan to layer in complexity by allowing for asynchronous delivery and buyer and seller identities, but we think it's best to start without those complications.

Each *unique* product you sell must have a DIN. That means a product would be "example.eth" rather than "ENS Domain." DINs can ultimately be thought of as being disposable. If you sell me "example.eth" with a DIN of 1000000079 and I resell it to someone else with a DIN of 1000000842, that's fine. If I then want to reuse 1000000842 to sell "anotherdomain.eth," that's also fine because the order will capture the metadata of the product at the time it is sold. However, any reputation system built on top of Kiosk will likely reset the product's reputation whenever its metadata changes. 

Unlike other product identification standards, the 10-digit DIN does not encode eny product information itself. It's simply a pointer to a market. This allows sellers to associate an unlimited amount of information with a DIN and common standards will emerge on how to store product information (image, description, color, manufacturer, etc.) on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) or something similar for Kiosk clients to parse and display. It would be too expensive to store all of this information directly on the public Ethereum blockchain.

For ERC20 tokens, "1 OmiseGo (OMG)" or "1,000 OmiseGo (OMG)" would both be valid examples of products that would have a DIN. The token could be priced using an on-chain algorithm like [Bancor](https://www.bancor.network/) or each individual order could be its own product. There are [a](https://etherdelta.com) [lot](https://kyber.network/) [of](https://swap.tech/) [projects](https://0xproject.com/) [trying](https://omega.one/) to come up with a decentralized mechanism for exchanging ERC20 tokens, so that is not our focus. If one or more of these projects finds a way to wrap their protocol with Kiosk's *buy* interface or wants to provide a way for markets to pay sellers in a token other than Kiosk Market Token, that would be great and we would love to help out.

Below, we'll walk you through the process to sell an ENS domain on the [ENS Market](https://github.com/kioskprotocol/kiosk/blob/master/contracts/ENS/ENSMarket.sol) we created. There's currently no user interface, so we'll show you do it through the command line.
