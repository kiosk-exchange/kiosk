# Introduction

Kiosk is an open-source platform that allows developers to create decentralized marketplaces on the Ethereum blockchain.

For all markets, the Kiosk protocol presents the end user with a single action â€” *buy*. This means there's no learning curve involved, whether you're buying an [ERC20 token](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) or a pair of [Alpaca socks](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Alpaca).

Developers can create markets that run according their own, custom rules, with the expectation that the best and most fair markets will win out over time.
